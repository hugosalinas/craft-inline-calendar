# Craft eXtension Inline Calendar

This Extension provides the ability to add a table that functions as a calendar. Only English is supported atm. This was built to help plan events by adding a calendar to your Note. 


## Building

Simply run `npm install` and then `npm run build` to generate the .craftX file which can be installed.
You can use `npm run dev` to test and debug in your local environment

## Notes 
At the time of development, the default <input type=date > had a bug where the date picker would close as soon as your mouse left the input box. flatpickr was implemented as a workaround. Its not perfect, but it works. 

Currently only english is supported.
